# 🏥 Clinic Management Database System  

This project is a **MySQL-based database system** designed to manage and streamline operations in a healthcare clinic.  
It provides structured storage and management for **patients, doctors, appointments, billing, medicines, and prescriptions**.  

The system ensures efficient handling of clinical data and demonstrates strong skills in **database design, ER modeling, and SQL queries**.  

## 📊 Database Management & Queries  

SQL queries were written to:  

- Store and manage **patients (Users)** and **doctors** data  
- Book and track **appointments** with status (Scheduled/Completed)  
- Record **billing details** with payment tracking (Paid/Unpaid)  
- Manage **medicines** and assign them to patients through **prescriptions**  
- Join multiple tables to generate meaningful reports, such as:  
  - Appointments by patient and doctor  
  - Billing reports by appointment  
  - Prescriptions linked to medicines and patients 

## 📈 Key Modules & Relationships  

- **Users** → Patients registered in the clinic  
- **Doctors** → Doctors with specialization and availability  
- **Appointments** → Connects patients and doctors with date & time  
- **Billing** → Tracks payments for each appointment  
- **Medicines** → Stores medicine details  
- **Prescriptions** → Maps medicines to patient appointments
